## What's The Difference?

Eventhough MusicBrainz English Capitalization Guidelines is quite similar to BookBrainz Style Guidelines, there are actually differences between these two.

1. **Prepositions** are always capitalized:

   |:-------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
   |When it is more than five letters long |When it is more than three letters long |
